The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built. A 100% cryptocurrency pegged decentralised stable coin that has no forced liquidation. (but is not without risk - as we’re about to find out).
It is an instantiation of the AgeUSD protocol designed in partnership by IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo.
It maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves, avoiding the need for liquidations.</description></item><item><title>ErgoMixer</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-12-ergomixer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:43:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-12-ergomixer/</guid><description>The Ergomixer is the first non-interactive, non-custodial mixer in the cryptocurrency space. There have been requests from the community to understand the mixer, why it is an important piece of tech, and why people would choose to use it. It is my hope that I can cover these questions in a way that a novice to the crypto space can understand and comprehend.  A non-interactive application is permissionless.</description></item><item><title>DeFi Ecosystem</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-10-defi-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 14:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-10-defi-ecosystem/</guid><description>Ergo Blockchain is Layer 1 Protocol for powerful Decentralized Finance Contracts that builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development.

This integration will allow Ergonauts to safely store their ERG tokens with the world&amp;rsquo;s most secure hardware wallet.
While there are many other ways users can store and interact with their ERG and tokens, the ledger provides a fully secure way to do this, ensuring that the private keys are never exposed to the internet directly when making a transaction.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain Privacy</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-01-blockchain-privacy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 11:42:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-01-blockchain-privacy/</guid><description>Bitcoin is often thought of as an anonymous currency used by criminals and hackers. While this myth has been dispelled many times, it still lingers on. The truth is that Bitcoin is a pseudonymous cryptocurrency. While no names or real identities are tied to addresses and transactions, these can all be seen through the public ledger that is the blockchain. While the alphanumeric wallet addresses do not give away any private information, there are ways in which these can be connected to real-world identities, including wallet transaction broadcasters who can link your address to an IP, and especially fiat on and off-ramps.</description></item><item><title>Chainlink Oracles vs. Ergo Oracle Pools</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-27-chainlink-oracles-vs-ergo-oracle-pools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 22:31:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-27-chainlink-oracles-vs-ergo-oracle-pools/</guid><description>The design of Ergo’s oracle pools are more efficient and programmable than using multiple single oracle data points such as in Chainlink’s oracle design. We build hierarchies of confidence using oracle pools and pools of oracle pools in Ergo. It&amp;rsquo;s faster, cheaper, and more beneficial to the end user.

Oracles in blockchain serve as messenger agents, connecting two distinct points of data sources while guarding the reliability of the information.</description></item><item><title>The Ergo Manifesto</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 18:19:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/</guid><description>The Ergo Manifesto is intended to educate and offer a vision of what blockchain technology can achieve. We hope to build society through a form of horizontal cooperation through production under the division of labor, trade and exchange, and solidarity and mutual aid. We believe this can be achieved while maintaining basic principles that benefit the wellbeing of all humans. Core principles that have been central to human rights and values must be maintained as our technological capacities evolve.</description></item><item><title>WrapAssets announces integration with ErgoDEX!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-21-wrapassets-announces-integration-with-ergodex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 10:58:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-21-wrapassets-announces-integration-with-ergodex/</guid><description>ErgoDEX team recently published Plutus Port proposal on Cardano’s Project Catalyst platform.

Through smart contracts, users can interact with dApps without middlemen. Blockchain design has a significant impact on the capabilities of smart contracts. Ergo Blockchain’s UTXO model allows multi-stage contracts to operate on a highly scalable network. Decentralized Finance The banking system is built solely on trust. However, this trust mechanism is a form of obligation that citizens don’t have any choice on. Banks and financial institutions produce and provide financial products such as loans or ETFs to financial markets.</description></item><item><title>Here’s how Ergo seeks to boost interoperability for Cardano’s eUTxO model</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-08-heres-how-ergo-seeks-to-boost-interoperability-for-cardanos-eutxo-model/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 06:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-08-heres-how-ergo-seeks-to-boost-interoperability-for-cardanos-eutxo-model/</guid><description>Blockchain interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain protocols to become compatible with one another. Achieving true blockchain interoperability among heterogeneous protocols is a prerequisite step for mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. This is true because many businesses are reluctant to build within a locked platform environment.
In this article, we are going to look at how Ergo platform will help in the interoperability of Cardano.

And while the altcoin’s dev team has been promising big things for many months now, the fact of the matter remains is that an increasing number of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects built atop the ecosystem — such as Harvest Finance, Yield.App, Value DeFi — have continued to expand their operations to other blockchains.</description></item><item><title>Ergo art competition: Winners Announced!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-03-18-ergo-art-competition-winners-announced/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 19:24:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-03-18-ergo-art-competition-winners-announced/</guid><description>The competition prompted some great entries. 2,000 ERG in prizes were ultimately distributed via bids to the winners.
Just over a month ago we announced the Ergo Digital Art Competition, celebrating the launch of NFTs and the Ergo Auction house on the Ergo blockchain.

This can be clearly seen by the total value locked (TVL) of over 6 million dollars worth of Ergs within the dApp as of writing. We at the Ergo Foundation have been closely monitoring how the community is using the SigUSD dApp, understanding the mechanics, and all of the different factors at play.</description></item><item><title>SigmaUSD - Ergo’s Community Deployed Stablecoin Is Live!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021_02_26-sigmausd-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021_02_26-sigmausd-released/</guid><description>The SigmaUSD stablecoin has been deployed by the community and is live and ready for all Ergonauts to use at https://sigmausd.io/
After several months of hearing whispers about a stablecoin being built and teasers being thrown around, the Ergo community enjoyed an information-packed Ergo Summit 2021 which explained everything they needed to know about the AgeUSD Protocol; a novel crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin protocol that has been created in joint partnership by the Ergo Foundation, EMURGO, and IOG on top of the Ergo Blockchain.</description></item><item><title>2000 ERG in Prizes to be Won in the Ergo Digital Art Competition!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-02-12-2000-erg-in-prizes-to-be-won-in-the-ergo-digital-art-competition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:17:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-02-12-2000-erg-in-prizes-to-be-won-in-the-ergo-digital-art-competition/</guid><description>Create an original piece of digital art and list it for sale on the Ergo NFT Marketplace.

As part of an ongoing joint initiative, Ergo and Cardano unveiled the design of a new stablecoin at the online Ergo Summit event, held on 23 January.
Named AgeUSD and inspired by StatiCoin, the stablecoin is the result of a collaboration between research and development teams across three organisations: IOG (IOHK), the company leading Cardano core development; Ergo Foundation; and blockchain technology company, Emurgo, also one of the founding members of Cardano.</description></item><item><title>How Ergo Makes the Most of Blockchain</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-20-how-ergo-makes-the-most-of-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 14:16:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-20-how-ergo-makes-the-most-of-blockchain/</guid><description>The concept of ‘marginal gains’ enables Ergo to push the capacity of first-generation blockchain technology further than other platforms.
With the explosion of interest in DeFi, perhaps the most compelling use case for smart contract blockchain platforms, one thing has become abundantly clear: blockchain is not ready for DeFi.
DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity.</description></item><item><title>What Ergo can contribute to DeFi interoperability</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-05-what-ergo-can-contribute-to-defi-interoperability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 07:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-05-what-ergo-can-contribute-to-defi-interoperability/</guid><description>Most users won’t care about the underlying blockchain they’re using – they will just want its functionality. That means DeFi interoperability will be critical.
Despite the open source nature of the blockchain world, crypto projects have always tended to have an ‘us-and-them’ mentality. The assumption is that for one platform to succeed, it must be at the expense of all the others. Hence marketing strategies that position one or other platform as the ‘Ethereum killer’, and other such claims.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Sigmaverse</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-27-introducing-the-sigmaverse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 20:20:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-27-introducing-the-sigmaverse/</guid><description>Your portal to Ergo’s dApp universe is opening.
Ergo has some amazing tech and some talented developers. However, as a decentralised and community-powered platform, it’s not always easy to know what’s going on all the time. Different people are developing different dApps and use cases, formally and informally. Connecting them to the same users and building that all-important DeFi network effect isn’t always easy.
That’s what the Sigmaverse is about. Sigmaverse is a one-stop portal to the Ergo dApp ecosystem: a place where users can find all the cool functionality that community developers are building on Ergo, all in one place.</description></item><item><title> 2021: The Next Battlegrounds for DeFi</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-18-2021-the-next-battlegrounds-for-defi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:20:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-18-2021-the-next-battlegrounds-for-defi/</guid><description>The challenge for Ergo and all DeFi platforms over the next year is to work towards the complete set of features that will enable DeFi to take on the conventional financial sector: decentralised atomic composability at scale with opt-in auditable privacy.
As 2020 draws to a close, it’s worth looking back at what has been a landmark year for crypto and DeFi.
Since the COVID-induced global market turbulence of March, we have seen crypto establish itself as an asset class as corporate investors began buying bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against dollar devaluation in the wake of unprecedented money printing.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Bootstrap, Streamlining Ergo dApp Infrastructure With One Simple Tool</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 09:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</guid><description>The Ergo ecosystem is quickly growing with new design patterns, tools, dApps, and more every single month. This is an exciting point in time for developers to jump in and get started.
That said, while building dApps on top of Ergo, vital infrastructure components to develop and run your dApp might be intimidating to set up for someone who is unfamiliar with the existing tooling. Between an Ergo full node, explorer back end, explorer front end, logging, and metrics, it can become quite overwhelming for a nascent dApp developer entering into the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Headless dApp Framework Now Available</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-08-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:10:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-08-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</guid><description>This new development will have a number of implications for the Ergo ecosystem and developers, making it far easier to build applications on Ergo.
In a recent article, we looked at the idea of ‘Headless’ dApps: portable dApp off-chain code that can be used by anyone to ship dApps easily by plugging different components together and adding an interface. On 30 November, a new release was made from the Emurgo code repository: the Ergo Headless dApp Framework (HDF)!</description></item><item><title>New Ergo Smart DEX Orders with buyback guarantees</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-02-new-ergo-smart-dex-orders-with-buyback-guarantees/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 18:43:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-02-new-ergo-smart-dex-orders-with-buyback-guarantees/</guid><description>The novel smart contract will trustlessly enable users to participate in token sales without the downside risks of regular ICOs.
2020 is shaping up to look at a lot like 2016 for crypto – suggesting that 2021 could be another 2017.
But while 2017’s epic crypto bull run was partially driven by the massive ICO hype, 2020’s has not been – and any continuing rally in 2021 will likewise not rely on these token sales.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to ‘Headless’ dApps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-27-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-27-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</guid><description>This new approach offers a streamlined interface for interacting with on-chain contracts, enabling anyone to build dApps using simple building blocks.
So-called headless dApps are a new idea in the blockchain world, and one that offers exciting new possibilities for developers and the DeFi sector. It’s also one that Ergo will be exploring in due course.

This is a unique, indivisible token mined by anon_real, one of Ergo’s anonymous devs.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Auction House, NFT Marketplace on Ergo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-16-announcing-the-auction-house-nft-marketplace-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 09:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-16-announcing-the-auction-house-nft-marketplace-on-ergo/</guid><description>The platform allows users to sell Ergo’s NFTs – an important development in the growing DeFi movement – securely and easily.
Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, aren’t a new development, but with the rise of the DeFi space they are gaining significance and finding new use cases.
NFTs are indivisible unique or limited-edition tokens that can be used to represent physical or digital items: anything from a house or car to a piece of digital art, a series of images, an in-game item or other collectible.</description></item><item><title>Learn ErgoScript by Example</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-12-learn-ergoscript-by-example/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:14:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-12-learn-ergoscript-by-example/</guid><description>The new resources provide a powerful but simple way to learn UTXO-based smart contracts.
Since its mainnet launch in July 2019, Ergo has steadily been building out both its core tech and its dapps ecosystem, with several unique developments in both. Ergo’s Sigma Protocols enable safe, customisable zero-knowledge proofs, which underpin such applications as ErgoMixer and the ZKTreasury. And there’s lots more to come!
To date, though, Ergo hasn’t been the most user-friendly ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Yoroi: your gateway to Ergo dapps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-09-yoroi-your-gateway-to-ergo-dapps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:44:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-09-yoroi-your-gateway-to-ergo-dapps/</guid><description>Yoroi, the flagship lite wallet app for the Cardano ecosystem developed by Emurgo, now supports Ergo! This development follows directly from the Ergo-Emurgo partnership announced in June this year.

At present, Yoroi functions as a multi-wallet for ADA and ERG tokens, enabling secure storage and transaction of your crypto.
In the coming months the Ergo integration within Yoroi will be developed further. Yoroi will become the gateway to Ergo’s ecosystem of Sigma Protocol-powered dApps.</description></item><item><title>What will DeFi look like in 10 years?</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-04-what-will-defi-look-like-in-10-years/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 17:13:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-04-what-will-defi-look-like-in-10-years/</guid><description>This is the first in a series of articles speculating on how the fast-emerging DeFi sector might evolve in the coming years.
The DeFi movement as it currently exists is only a few months old, and blockchain itself has barely existed a decade. Already, though, we are beginning to see themes crystallising and the first popular use cases becoming established.
As a DeFi platform that takes positioning for the future seriously, it’s important that Ergo has a vision – not only a sense of where things might be heading, but the role that it should itself be playing as these new decentralised financial services consolidate and grow in popularity.</description></item><item><title>NFTs on Ergo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 05:58:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</guid><description>As with almost every other area of DeFi, Ergo Platform takes a different approach to NFTs that offers some interesting and unique use cases and benefits.
NFTs look set to become the next major frontier for blockchain. Over the course of this year, crypto has become an accepted and practically mainstream (if still new) means of hedging against inflation and storing value. The emergence of DeFi as a use case for blockchain has similarly been impressive over the past few months, regardless of the issues that still need to be solved.</description></item><item><title>DeFi: Finance, but not always Decentralised?</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-17-defi-finance-but-not-always-decentralised/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 19:04:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-17-defi-finance-but-not-always-decentralised/</guid><description>As a recent blog post explored, DeFi – decentralised finance – can and will be used in whatever ways developers and the market see fit. This is the nature of open, decentralised systems. You can’t stop it, and there’s a very strong argument for saying we shouldn’t try. To restrict any element of DeFi, at least at the protocol level, is to introduce centralisation and single points of failure, thereby killing the core innovation by misguidedly trying to protect it.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the ZK Treasury on Ergo!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 18:54:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-04-announcing-the-zk-treasury-on-ergo/</guid><description>Ergo’s Zero-Knowledge Treasury enables users to easily create joint digital signatures, with bespoke conditions for spending funds, while ensuring the signatories to the created address remain hidden.

It is decentralisation that brings the benefits of transparency, accessibility, security, immutability, composability, efficiency and more besides to these new financial initiatives.
As a DeFi platform that aims to take and build on the best features of Bitcoin, Ergo is committed to decentralisation.
And so it is with a mixture of interest, concern, excitement, dismay and, frankly, awe that we watch the current DeFi craze for Yield Farming unfold.</description></item><item><title>Ergo’s Oracle Pools, and what they mean for the ecosystem</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-31-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:31:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-31-ergos-oracle-pools-and-what-they-mean-for-the-ecosystem/</guid><description>The new scheme developed through the Emurgo-Ergo partnership will see oracle pools – core blockchain infrastructure – run as a public service, accessible by any dApp and developer, free at the point of use.
Oracles are a crucial element of DeFi infrastructure. They are the bridge between the siloed world of the blockchain and data from the real world, and so are vital for DeFi to reach its full potential. The integrity of major use cases, including stablecoins and lending platforms, rely on oracles that are fit for purpose.</description></item><item><title>Transcript of the Oracle Pools Q&amp;A session with Robert Kornacki</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-28-transcript-of-first-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:59:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-28-transcript-of-first-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</guid><description>Robert Kornacki

Money is changing. It’s interesting that, at a time when money is increasingly being trivialised and devalued through enormous quantitative easing, evolution and innovation in a parallel sphere is qualitatively improving money. One of the key ways in which blockchain is enhancing money is programmability.
Money is just information. Once that basic principle has been accepted, it opens a whole new arena and value proposition for cash.</description></item><item><title>Ergo’s Vision for DeFi: Ergo vs CBDCs</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 18:44:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</guid><description>As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides.

The narrative around blockchain technology is evolving in front of us. The use cases for smart contract platforms are becoming clearer by the day, encapsulated in the catch-all term of ‘DeFi’, or Decentralised Finance.

The stablecoin space is still relatively young and underserved – but that’s changing fast.
Stablecoins are one of the most important and popular DeFi products, enabling users to hedge and store value on the blockchain, without having to use exchanges or other centralised providers.

Introduction ErgoScript is the smart contract language used by the Ergo blockchain. While it has concise syntax adopted from Scala/Kotlin, it still may seem confusing at first because conceptually ErgoScript is quite different compared to conventional languages which we all know and love. This is because Ergo is a UTXO based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account based systems like Ethereum.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Atomic Swaps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/</guid><description>Because a blockchain is a siloed, self-contained system by design, interacting with other blockchain protocols is challenging. Atomic Swaps enable cross-chain exchange of digital assets, avoiding the need for centralised exchanges.
Blockchains are excellent at decentralised value transfer within their own domains. That is, you can send BTC to any Bitcoin address securely and easily, and you can send LTC to any Litecoin address securely and easily too.
But because blockchains are based on consensus between miners, they are not designed to interface with other blockchains.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Oracles</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_04_building_ergo_oracles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_04_building_ergo_oracles/</guid><description>Blockchains are siloed systems that can only reference their own data, established by consensus. Oracles are the solution to the problem of working with external information, which is vital for many everyday use cases.
Blockchains are intentionally self-contained. They reference information only recorded within their immediate ecosystem, that has been agreed upon by a majority of miners. Since the whole point of a blockchain, based on consensus, is that there are no sources of centralisation or single points of failure, that poses a problem.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Storage rent</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/</guid><description>We’ve designed Ergo with long-term economic sustainability in mind, and storage rent is one of the ways we’re ensuring miners stay profitable well into the future. One community member, Robert, describes this function as ‘on-chain garbage collection’ that reduces the problem of blockchain bloat – and even makes it profitable.

Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots.
As lockdowns across the world effectively shut down whole sectors and a large part of the economy, we are entering a new era at breakneck pace. Central banks are taking unprecedented action in the form of money printing but, just like last time around, they will almost certainly fail at the ‘last mile’ (intentionally or otherwise): while their efforts will benefit the financial sector and the wealthy, the funds will not reach those small businesses and individuals who need them the most.</description></item><item><title>Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_hot_potato/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_hot_potato/</guid><description>As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit.

You can use ErgoTool without running your own Ergo node. Even though running a node is the most secure way to communicate with the Ergo blockchain network, ErgoTool however, aims to provide more foundational tools at your disposal. Surely, you still can use it with your own running node.
In this post we will walk through simple steps to generate a mnemonic phrase, create a local secret storage and use it to send ERGs between addresses, all with the help of ErgoTool commands.</description></item><item><title>Mining Ergo for Fun and Profit</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_22_mining_for_fun/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_22_mining_for_fun/</guid><description>Ergo GPU Mining This article will help you start mining Ergo using a GPU.
Ergo mining is based on Autolykos, a Proof-of-Work algorithm designed to be ASIC and pool resistant. Miners have to perform memory-hard computations~(at least 4 GB memory is needed, but the current most efficient implementation utilizes between 8 GB of vRAM) that makes Ergo friendly for GPU mining. In addition, Autolykos requires access to private keys, thereby preventing mining pool formation.</description></item><item><title>The Ergo Cast: Understanding Ergo One Episode At A Time</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_16_podcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_16_podcast/</guid><description>Since the launch of the Ergo mainnet half a year ago, there has been an incredible amount of development and progress in the Ergo ecosystem. Auction smart contracts, crowdfunding, zero interest loans, privacy preserving protocols, and much more. Every week or two there&amp;rsquo;s some truly novel idea or development put out, however if you&amp;rsquo;re just an average blockchain enthusiast it&amp;rsquo;s likely you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard too much.
Why is that? The reason is that the Ergo ecosystem is making incredible strides forward in the technology side of things, however there is a distinct lack of content to consume for the average user who is interested.</description></item><item><title>A New Quest for Decentralization, Part I: Technical Aspects</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_12_new_quest/</guid><description>While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often means selling out to the Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with decentralization or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about decentralization.

It does not cover mining.
Node security There are a few important aspects of node usage that your wallet and money&amp;rsquo;s safety depends on:
An Ergo node requires storing security-critical parameters in the configuration file. You should never make this file public. An Ergo node provides a REST API for interacting with the built-in wallet. Sensitive API methods require a security token, which should never be sent over untrusted channels.</description></item><item><title>Ergo and crowdfunding</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_09_06_crowdfund/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_09_06_crowdfund/</guid><description>What is Crowdfunding? Crowdfunding is a way of raising capital through the collective efforts of individuals. The campaigns are mostly started via the world wide web and allow projects and businesses to be funded by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people. One of the best known examples for successful crowdfunding startups is Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset. The company Oculus VR initiated its campaign in 2012 and was only two years later acquired by Facebook for $2 billion total.</description></item><item><title>Mining ERGO on AMD Cards</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_08_07_amd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_08_07_amd/</guid><description>This tutorial will provide you with the information needed to get your AMD cards mining ERGO on either Windows or Linux.

Part 1. Preliminaries An important design decision in a cryptocurrency protocol is specifying what a spending transaction actually spends. There are two possibilities here.

What are the vision about scaling and adoption? About scaling, the main approach is to avoid bloat without compromising functionality. E.g. persistent updateable storage is possible, with updates to be checked by a blockchain contract, but only digest of authenticated data structure (and some additional bytes, less than 40 bytes anyway) are stored in the UTXO set dependless on data set size.</description></item><item><title>Smart Contracts for the People</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2018_10_19-smart-contracts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2018_10_19-smart-contracts/</guid><description>A lot of blockchain-related news these days are saying us that a bank X or a corporation Y is going to use a &amp;ldquo;blockchain&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;reduce costs&amp;rdquo;.

While I am avoiding to say anything about &amp;ldquo;Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s vision&amp;rdquo; (nothing but speculations could be dug there after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich the ordinary people behind their small businesses providing no much above making ends meet, not depersonalized big financial capital.</description></item></channel></rss>
