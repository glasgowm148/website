This integration will allow Ergonauts to safely store their ERG tokens with the world&amp;rsquo;s most secure hardware wallet.
While there are many other ways users can store and interact with their ERG and tokens, the ledger provides a fully secure way to do this, ensuring that the private keys are never exposed to the internet directly when making a transaction.</description></item><item><title>WrapAssets announces integration with ErgoDEX!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-21-wrapassets-announces-integration-with-ergodex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 10:58:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-21-wrapassets-announces-integration-with-ergodex/</guid><description>ErgoDEX team recently published Plutus Port proposal on Cardano’s Project Catalyst platform.
