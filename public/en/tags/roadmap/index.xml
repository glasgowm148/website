As 2020 draws to a close, it’s worth looking back at what has been a landmark year for crypto and DeFi.
Since the COVID-induced global market turbulence of March, we have seen crypto establish itself as an asset class as corporate investors began buying bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against dollar devaluation in the wake of unprecedented money printing.</description></item><item><title>Yoroi: your gateway to Ergo dapps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-09-yoroi-your-gateway-to-ergo-dapps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:44:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-09-yoroi-your-gateway-to-ergo-dapps/</guid><description>Yoroi, the flagship lite wallet app for the Cardano ecosystem developed by Emurgo, now supports Ergo!

At present, Yoroi functions as a multi-wallet for ADA and ERG tokens, enabling secure storage and transaction of your crypto.
In the coming months the Ergo integration within Yoroi will be developed further. Yoroi will become the gateway to Ergo’s ecosystem of Sigma Protocol-powered dApps.</description></item><item><title>Ergo roadmap for 2020</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-04-ergo-roadmap-for-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 14:02:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-04-ergo-roadmap-for-2020/</guid><description>Future dates at time of publication are subject to change
