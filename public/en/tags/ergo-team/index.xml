Ergo has some amazing tech and some talented developers. However, as a decentralised and community-powered platform, it’s not always easy to know what’s going on all the time. Different people are developing different dApps and use cases, formally and informally. Connecting them to the same users and building that all-important DeFi network effect isn’t always easy.
That’s what the Sigmaverse is about. Sigmaverse is a one-stop portal to the Ergo dApp ecosystem: a place where users can find all the cool functionality that community developers are building on Ergo, all in one place.</description></item><item><title> 2021: The Next Battlegrounds for DeFi</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-18-2021-the-next-battlegrounds-for-defi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:20:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-18-2021-the-next-battlegrounds-for-defi/</guid><description>The challenge for Ergo and all DeFi platforms over the next year is to work towards the complete set of features that will enable DeFi to take on the conventional financial sector: decentralised atomic composability at scale with opt-in auditable privacy.
As 2020 draws to a close, it’s worth looking back at what has been a landmark year for crypto and DeFi.
Since the COVID-induced global market turbulence of March, we have seen crypto establish itself as an asset class as corporate investors began buying bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against dollar devaluation in the wake of unprecedented money printing.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to ‘Headless’ dApps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-27-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-11-27-an-introduction-to-headless-dapps/</guid><description>This new approach offers a streamlined interface for interacting with on-chain contracts, enabling anyone to build dApps using simple building blocks.
So-called headless dApps are a new idea in the blockchain world, and one that offers exciting new possibilities for developers and the DeFi sector. It’s also one that Ergo will be exploring in due course.
Before we make further announcements, it’s worth exploring the idea a little further. If you’re new to the idea of headless dApps, you’ll likely have questions&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Transcript of the Oracle Pools Q&amp;A session with Robert Kornacki</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-28-transcript-of-first-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:59:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-28-transcript-of-first-q-a-session-with-robert-kornacki/</guid><description>Robert Kornacki
I&amp;rsquo;d like to officially announce that Oracle Pools are live, running on mainnet, with all the code + detailed instructions available for you to start/run your own, and we have a beautiful frontend created by DeadIT now implemented in the explorer https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pools-list
Can Ergo Oracle Pools be used on Eth projects?
A similar system could be developed &amp;amp; deployed on Eth, but all the data is posted on the Ergo blockchain so available to all Ergo users.</description></item><item><title>Ergo-Emurgo partnership yields new model for oracles</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_30_ergo_emurgo_oracles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_30_ergo_emurgo_oracles/</guid><description>The joint research on oracle pools will be implemented in the Ergo stablecoin project.
Oracles are one of the critical elements of DeFi, providing a link between the siloed and self-contained world of the blockchain, and real-world data. It is imperative that dApps have access to reliable price data, among other information, in order to execute effectively and securely.
New research from the Ergo-Emurgo partnership offers a new way to approach the problem of achieving consensus and posting data to the blockchain: Oracle Pools.</description></item><item><title>The opportunities of the Ergo/Emurgo partnership</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_11_emurgo_ergo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_11_emurgo_ergo/</guid><description>Cardano and Ergo take quite different approaches to DeFi and blockchain development, but there are specific areas in which they significantly overlap. This allows the possibility of fruitful collaboration, with benefits to two distinct ecosystems – and the blockchain space as a whole.
The recent partnership announced between Emurgo and Ergo has been positively received by both communities. For good reason: this is an exceptional opportunity to pool resources into an important and emerging area of research, while allowing both projects to use the insights gained in their own ways and for their own roadmaps.</description></item><item><title>Press release: Ergo Foundation partners with Emurgo to research and develop new DeFi solutions</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_09_press_release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_06_09_press_release/</guid><description>The collaboration will encompass a range of objectives – including exploration of a decentralised stablecoin solution.
Ergo, the smart contracts platform designed by former IOHK engineers, and Emurgo, a global blockchain solutions firm and one of the founding entities of Cardano, have entered into a partnership with the aim of furthering the DeFi space with ambitious new research and technology.
Research-driven technology Both Ergo and Emurgo have a reputation for taking an academically-rigorous approach to development, basing their technology on peer-reviewed research by top cryptographers and blockchain specialists.</description></item><item><title>Ergo update, 14 May 2020: New exchange, wallet and first mining pool with collaterals!</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_14_updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_14_updates/</guid><description>We have three great new developments to announce to the Ergo community, all of which will boost our user base and decentralisation!

Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots.
As lockdowns across the world effectively shut down whole sectors and a large part of the economy, we are entering a new era at breakneck pace. Central banks are taking unprecedented action in the form of money printing but, just like last time around, they will almost certainly fail at the ‘last mile’ (intentionally or otherwise): while their efforts will benefit the financial sector and the wealthy, the funds will not reach those small businesses and individuals who need them the most.</description></item><item><title>Ergo use cases: safe, simple financial contracts</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_29_ergo_use/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_29_ergo_use/</guid><description>Ergo enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by smart contracts built on flexible and powerful Sigma protocols but easily accessible to developers.
One of the most exciting things about blockchain is the possibility of making digital agreements without any trusted intermediaries. In the simplest use case, pioneered by Bitcoin, Alice can send a payment directly to Bob, wherever the two of them are located around the world, with no bank or any trusted third party needed.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Sigma protocols</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_16_ergo_sigma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_16_ergo_sigma/</guid><description>Ergo’s smart contracts and DeFi functionality are built on Sigma protocols – a powerful, flexible class of zero-knowledge proofs. Find out more about why they’re so important, and how they put Ergo head and shoulders above the competition.
Cryptography is a fascinating area, and one of the most exciting and intriguing concepts it offers are zero-knowledge proofs. In simple terms, a zero-knowledge proof allows someone to prove they know the solution to a problem without actually revealing the solution itself.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Σ3 – ErgoMixer</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_20_ergo_mixer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_20_ergo_mixer/</guid><description>The project uses Ergo’s Sigma protocols to enable efficient, trustless mixing of funds, enabling a high degree of privacy while ensuring security is not compromised.

Ergo mining is based on Autolykos, a Proof-of-Work algorithm designed to be ASIC and pool resistant. Miners have to perform memory-hard computations~(at least 4 GB memory is needed, but the current most efficient implementation utilizes between 8 GB of vRAM) that makes Ergo friendly for GPU mining. In addition, Autolykos requires access to private keys, thereby preventing mining pool formation.</description></item><item><title>How to set up and configure a full Ergo node</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/</guid><description>This tutorial explains how to install and run a full Ergo node. It does not cover mining.
Node security There are a few important aspects of node usage that your wallet and money&amp;rsquo;s safety depends on:
An Ergo node requires storing security-critical parameters in the configuration file. You should never make this file public. An Ergo node provides a REST API for interacting with the built-in wallet. Sensitive API methods require a security token, which should never be sent over untrusted channels.</description></item></channel></rss>
