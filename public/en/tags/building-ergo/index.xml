The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built. A 100% cryptocurrency pegged decentralised stable coin that has no forced liquidation. (but is not without risk - as we’re about to find out).
It is an instantiation of the AgeUSD protocol designed in partnership by IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo.
It maintains the conservative settings for collateral reserves, avoiding the need for liquidations.</description></item><item><title>ErgoMixer</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-12-ergomixer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:43:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-05-12-ergomixer/</guid><description>The Ergomixer is the first non-interactive, non-custodial mixer in the cryptocurrency space.

While this myth has been dispelled many times, it still lingers on. The truth is that Bitcoin is a pseudonymous cryptocurrency. While no names or real identities are tied to addresses and transactions, these can all be seen through the public ledger that is the blockchain. While the alphanumeric wallet addresses do not give away any private information, there are ways in which these can be connected to real-world identities, including wallet transaction broadcasters who can link your address to an IP, and especially fiat on and off-ramps.</description></item><item><title>Chainlink Oracles vs. Ergo Oracle Pools</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-27-chainlink-oracles-vs-ergo-oracle-pools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 22:31:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-27-chainlink-oracles-vs-ergo-oracle-pools/</guid><description>The design of Ergo’s oracle pools are more efficient and programmable than using multiple single oracle data points such as in Chainlink’s oracle design. We build hierarchies of confidence using oracle pools and pools of oracle pools in Ergo. It&amp;rsquo;s faster, cheaper, and more beneficial to the end user.

Ergo Blockchain’s UTXO model allows multi-stage contracts to operate on a highly scalable network. Decentralized Finance The banking system is built solely on trust. However, this trust mechanism is a form of obligation that citizens don’t have any choice on.

Achieving true blockchain interoperability among heterogeneous protocols is a prerequisite step for mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. This is true because many businesses are reluctant to build within a locked platform environment.
In this article, we are going to look at how Ergo platform will help in the interoperability of Cardano.

As part of an ongoing joint initiative, Ergo and Cardano unveiled the design of a new stablecoin at the online Ergo Summit event, held on 23 January.
Named AgeUSD and inspired by StatiCoin, the stablecoin is the result of a collaboration between research and development teams across three organisations: IOG (IOHK), the company leading Cardano core development; Ergo Foundation; and blockchain technology company, Emurgo, also one of the founding members of Cardano.</description></item><item><title>How Ergo Makes the Most of Blockchain</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-20-how-ergo-makes-the-most-of-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 14:16:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-20-how-ergo-makes-the-most-of-blockchain/</guid><description>The concept of ‘marginal gains’ enables Ergo to push the capacity of first-generation blockchain technology further than other platforms.
With the explosion of interest in DeFi, perhaps the most compelling use case for smart contract blockchain platforms, one thing has become abundantly clear: blockchain is not ready for DeFi.
DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity.</description></item><item><title>What Ergo can contribute to DeFi interoperability</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-05-what-ergo-can-contribute-to-defi-interoperability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 07:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-01-05-what-ergo-can-contribute-to-defi-interoperability/</guid><description>Most users won’t care about the underlying blockchain they’re using – they will just want its functionality. That means DeFi interoperability will be critical.
Despite the open source nature of the blockchain world, crypto projects have always tended to have an ‘us-and-them’ mentality. The assumption is that for one platform to succeed, it must be at the expense of all the others. Hence marketing strategies that position one or other platform as the ‘Ethereum killer’, and other such claims.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Sigmaverse</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-27-introducing-the-sigmaverse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 20:20:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-27-introducing-the-sigmaverse/</guid><description>Your portal to Ergo’s dApp universe is opening.
Ergo has some amazing tech and some talented developers. However, as a decentralised and community-powered platform, it’s not always easy to know what’s going on all the time. Different people are developing different dApps and use cases, formally and informally. Connecting them to the same users and building that all-important DeFi network effect isn’t always easy.
That’s what the Sigmaverse is about. Sigmaverse is a one-stop portal to the Ergo dApp ecosystem: a place where users can find all the cool functionality that community developers are building on Ergo, all in one place.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Bootstrap, Streamlining Ergo dApp Infrastructure With One Simple Tool</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 09:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-11-ergo-bootstrap-streamlining-ergo-dapp-infrastructure-with-one-simple-tool/</guid><description>The Ergo ecosystem is quickly growing with new design patterns, tools, dApps, and more every single month. This is an exciting point in time for developers to jump in and get started.
That said, while building dApps on top of Ergo, vital infrastructure components to develop and run your dApp might be intimidating to set up for someone who is unfamiliar with the existing tooling. Between an Ergo full node, explorer back end, explorer front end, logging, and metrics, it can become quite overwhelming for a nascent dApp developer entering into the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Headless dApp Framework Now Available</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-08-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:10:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-12-08-ergo-headless-dapp-framework-now-available/</guid><description>This new development will have a number of implications for the Ergo ecosystem and developers, making it far easier to build applications on Ergo.

The DeFi movement as it currently exists is only a few months old, and blockchain itself has barely existed a decade. Already, though, we are beginning to see themes crystallising and the first popular use cases becoming established.
As a DeFi platform that takes positioning for the future seriously, it’s important that Ergo has a vision – not only a sense of where things might be heading, but the role that it should itself be playing as these new decentralised financial services consolidate and grow in popularity.</description></item><item><title>NFTs on Ergo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 05:58:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-25-nfts-on-ergo/</guid><description>As with almost every other area of DeFi, Ergo Platform takes a different approach to NFTs that offers some interesting and unique use cases and benefits.
NFTs look set to become the next major frontier for blockchain.

The emergence of DeFi as a use case for blockchain has similarly been impressive over the past few months, regardless of the issues that still need to be solved.</description></item><item><title>DeFi: Finance, but not always Decentralised?</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-17-defi-finance-but-not-always-decentralised/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 19:04:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-09-17-defi-finance-but-not-always-decentralised/</guid><description>As a recent blog post explored, DeFi – decentralised finance – can and will be used in whatever ways developers and the market see fit. This is the nature of open, decentralised systems. You can’t stop it, and there’s a very strong argument for saying we shouldn’t try.

Money is just information. Once that basic principle has been accepted, it opens a whole new arena and value proposition for cash.</description></item><item><title>Ergo’s Vision for DeFi: Ergo vs CBDCs</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 18:44:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-17-ergos-vision-for-defi-ergo-vs-cbdcs/</guid><description>As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides.
Central bank digital currencies are no longer a theoretical application of blockchain technology. The list of countries developing CBDCs is growing rapidly, with several now trialing state-backed digital cash.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Our Vision for DeFi</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-13-building-ergo-our-vision-for-defi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:27:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-08-13-building-ergo-our-vision-for-defi/</guid><description>Everyone is talking about DeFi. Few people are asking what DeFi should look like. Ergo has a vision for what the sector can become.
2020 is shaping up to be the year in which Decentralised Finance rose to mainstream attention, in the same way that Bitcoin and blockchain did in 2016 and 2017. In July alone, Total Value Locked – the amount of funds committed to DeFi dApps’ smart contracts – doubled from $2 billion to $4 billion, largely driven by Compound’s distribution of its COMP governance tokens.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Exchange Contracts on Ergo</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-07-31-decentralized-exchange-contracts-on-ergo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:46:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-07-31-decentralized-exchange-contracts-on-ergo/</guid><description>Ergo has expressive smart contracts and transactional model which allows for an implementation of trustless DEX protocol, in which signed buy and sell orders can be put into the blockchain independently by buyers and sellers. An off-chain matching service can observe the Ergo blockchain, find matching orders, and submit the swap transaction without knowing any secrets. The matching can be incentivized by DEX reward paid as part of a swap transaction.</description></item><item><title>Ergo Foundation - New members and contests</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-07-27-ergo-foundation-new-members-and-contests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 20:21:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-07-27-ergo-foundation-new-members-and-contests/</guid><description>Ergo Foundation, a community-driven entity, is welcoming its new member Robert Kornacki, head of research and development engineer at EMURGO https://emurgo.io. This addition will help with the development of the ecosystem, promotion, and the widespread adoption and use of the Ergo Platform and its native token (ERG). There are many more members nominated to join the foundation, everyone is also free to apply.
Ergo Foundation would like to announce two sponsored competitions: for open-source mining software, including optimizations for both Nvidia and AMD which should fit greatly incoming HF changes and enable better competition in case of the new POW algorithm in the cryptocurrency space.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Lite full nodes</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_08_lite_full_nodes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_08_lite_full_nodes/</guid><description>Ergo allows any user to run a full node with low resources – meaning you can help maintain the network with a device as simple as a Raspberry Pi.
In a previous post, we looked at Ergo’s SPV mode, which allows for secure, efficient mobile clients. This enables users to make transactions using almost any device.
At the other end of the scale, you might want to run a full node.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: SPV security</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_1_spv_security/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_05_1_spv_security/</guid><description>There’s often a tension in the crypto world between security and convenience. That trade-off is unacceptable if we want these technologies to be widely used. Here’s how Ergo addresses one common and very important issue.
We all know that the most secure way to use Bitcoin, or any crypto, is to download a copy of the blockchain and run a full node yourself. That way, every time you or anyone else makes a transaction, your client checks the blockchain to ensure it’s valid.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Atomic Swaps</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_24_atomic_swaps/</guid><description>Because a blockchain is a siloed, self-contained system by design, interacting with other blockchain protocols is challenging. Atomic Swaps enable cross-chain exchange of digital assets, avoiding the need for centralised exchanges.
Blockchains are excellent at decentralised value transfer within their own domains. That is, you can send BTC to any Bitcoin address securely and easily, and you can send LTC to any Litecoin address securely and easily too.
But because blockchains are based on consensus between miners, they are not designed to interface with other blockchains.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Oracles</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_04_building_ergo_oracles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_04_building_ergo_oracles/</guid><description>Blockchains are siloed systems that can only reference their own data, established by consensus. Oracles are the solution to the problem of working with external information, which is vital for many everyday use cases.
Blockchains are intentionally self-contained. They reference information only recorded within their immediate ecosystem, that has been agreed upon by a majority of miners. Since the whole point of a blockchain, based on consensus, is that there are no sources of centralisation or single points of failure, that poses a problem.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Storage rent</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_21_ergo_positioning/</guid><description>We’ve designed Ergo with long-term economic sustainability in mind, and storage rent is one of the ways we’re ensuring miners stay profitable well into the future. One community member, Robert, describes this function as ‘on-chain garbage collection’ that reduces the problem of blockchain bloat – and even makes it profitable.
The 2020 block reward reduction will probably be the most important halving Bitcoin ever experiences. This is the point where the narrative of programmatic scarcity and digital gold will truly be proven, in the context of the sharpest economic downturn in living memory.</description></item><item><title>Ergo use case: Local Exchange Trading System (LETS)</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_cases/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_cases/</guid><description>The need to reform the global financial system has been clear since the last crisis in 2008. Now, COVID-19 has forced our hands. We cannot delay, and the best way to start is from the grassroots.
As lockdowns across the world effectively shut down whole sectors and a large part of the economy, we are entering a new era at breakneck pace. Central banks are taking unprecedented action in the form of money printing but, just like last time around, they will almost certainly fail at the ‘last mile’ (intentionally or otherwise): while their efforts will benefit the financial sector and the wealthy, the funds will not reach those small businesses and individuals who need them the most.</description></item><item><title>Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_hot_potato/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_02_use_hot_potato/</guid><description>As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve.
Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.
When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: Sigma protocols</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_16_ergo_sigma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_16_ergo_sigma/</guid><description>Ergo’s smart contracts and DeFi functionality are built on Sigma protocols – a powerful, flexible class of zero-knowledge proofs. Find out more about why they’re so important, and how they put Ergo head and shoulders above the competition.
Cryptography is a fascinating area, and one of the most exciting and intriguing concepts it offers are zero-knowledge proofs. In simple terms, a zero-knowledge proof allows someone to prove they know the solution to a problem without actually revealing the solution itself.</description></item><item><title>Building Ergo: UTXO vs Account</title><link>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_03_building_utxo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_03_03_building_utxo/</guid><description>Ergo takes the most secure and best-established features of Bitcoin and implements advanced new cryptographic features on its rock-solid foundations. This series explores the choices we have made in creating Ergo, with the first article unpacking the advantages of the UTXO model.
When you’re dealing with financial value, you cannot afford to take chances. Every architecture decision in a cryptocurrency platform has implications. While there are different ways to solve the same problem, some solutions are better tested and more reliable than others.</description></item></channel></rss>
