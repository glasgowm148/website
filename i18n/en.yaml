  translation: "Blockchain is a rapidly-advancing field that offers many exciting developments, with more applications and use cases appearing every day. However, this innovation often comes with a ‘move fast and break things’ approach to software development that doesn’t sit well when dealing with millions or even billions of dollars of users’ financial value.
    <br/><br/>
    Ergo draws on ten years of blockchain development, complementing tried and tested principles with the best peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models and digital currencies. We start with solid blockchain basics and implement new and powerful cryptography natively. Our team has a solid background in core development with cryptocurrencies and blockchain frameworks including Nxt, Scorex and Waves, and our lean approach means we can prioritise new features and requirements quickly.

  translation: "In our different experiences of working with blockchain platforms, we’ve learned that conventional Turing-complete smart contracts may be powerful, but they can be risky. Implementing complex computational tasks on the blockchain can have unintended consequences. Network conditions, bugs and code exploits can mean it’s impossible to know how expensive it is to execute software – or whether that code will run as intended at all. That can lead to security vulnerabilities and faulty dApps.
    <br/><br/>
    Ergo’s smart contracts allow us to execute wide-ranging tasks, but we always know in advance how much the code will cost and whether it will run successfully. Meanwhile, we can still write Turing-complete scripts by iterating processes across multiple blocks. That means Ergo can support versatile dApps that run predictably, with known costs, and don’t have any of the dangers of unrestricted functionality.

  translation: "
    Sigma protocols are the foundation of Ergo’s smart contracts. They allow for a class of efficient zero-knowledge protocols that enable us to implement tasks that would otherwise be either impossible, or else risky and expensive.
    <br/><br/>
    For example, Sigma protocols let us implement ring and threshold signatures out of the box. Let’s say you want to create a ‘ring spending contract’, where either of us can make a transaction from the same address, but we don’t want anyone else to know which one of us is spending the funds. That’s not possible with Bitcoin. And, while it can be done with Ethereum, it would be expensive and complicated – especially with a ring size of 10 or 20 members, which would be required for robust privacy.
    <br/><br/>
    With Ergo, this kind of application can be created easily, thanks to the integration of Sigma protocols in the core. This enables self-sovereign application-level privacy: trustless scripts that can be used to access mixers or other functionality, without any third parties required at all.
  "

- id: ergo_contractual_text
  translation: "
    Each script is applied to an unspent output. We have drawn this feature from the Bitcoin protocol, which also uses UTXOs or the ‘coin’ model, rather than an ‘account’ model like Ethereum’s. We consider this a more secure approach, since boxes are immutable, as well as being more flexible.
    <br/><br/>
    Ergo’s blockchain uses the Autolykos algorithm for consensus, which is a variant of Equihash and offers better ASIC resistance, as well as a degree of pool resistance. This enables better decentralization, avoiding large pools that can collude or be coerced to attack the network. At the same time, we recognise that ordinary users who do not run a full node should enjoy the same security benefits as miners. Ergo’s non-interactive proof-of-proof-of-work (NiPoPoW) allows anyone to make and verify transactions with complete confidence, without needing the storage, bandwidth and time required to download the full blockchain. In fact, as little as 1 MB of data is required – meaning any device can be used.
    <br/><br/>

- id: ergo_survivability_text
  translation: "
    Like many other features in Ergo, the network’s economic model is based on Bitcoin’s approach. We believe that digital scarcity is important for underpinning value, and have capped coin supply at under 100 million ERG. Unlike Bitcoin, the block rewards decrease steadily after the first two years, with no long tail of emission. Block rewards start at 75 ERG, and over a period of eight years will fall to zero, after which total supply will be fixed.
    <br/><br/>
    At this point, in addition to transaction fees, miners will also benefit from storage rent fees charged on boxes (UTXOs) that have not moved their coins for four years or more. There are at least two advantages to this approach. Firstly, it gives miners an additional source of revenues once block rewards end. Since the security of the network depends on hashrate and miner participation, this is an important incentive to provide. Secondly, it has the effect of recycling lost coins (and dust) back into the Ergo economy. Research suggests that up to 4 million BTC have been permanently removed from circulation due to lost private keys. Ergo’s storage fees will slowly reclaim these for productive purposes, while users who want to hold coins for the long term can avoid being charged simply by moving their funds.
    <br/><br/>

  "

- id: ergo_clients_text
  translation: "
    There is a difficult balance between ensuring a project is adequately funded and potentially disadvantaging later users if a large proportion of tokens is pre-mined or reserved in an ICO. We have chosen a strategy that has proven successful for other cryptocurrencies, whereby a percentage of tokens from each block reward is allocated for development and marketing.
    <br/><br/>
    In Ergo’s case, these Foundation tokens are managed by a smart contract built into the protocol. 10% of each block reward for the first two years, or 7.5 ERG per block, are allocated to the Treasury, with the remaining 67.5 ERG going to miners. As block rewards begin to reduce after two years, the Foundation will continue to receive rewards over 67.5 ERG, with the Treasury allocation dropping to zero after 2.5 years.

  translation: "Ergo was created in response to stagnation in the blockchain area.
                It implements various technical and economic ready-to-use ideas that add value but do not reduce the known advantages of blockchain systems.
                Ergo’s primary focus is to provide an efficient and secure way to implement financial contracts, which are the most widely used application of blockchain technology.
                It is created to provide an easy way to use financial contracts by ordinary people, that should be able to use them in a decentralized manner without any trust.
                Unlike the traditional financial system, no bailouts, blacklists or other forms of discrimination should be possible on the core level of Ergo protocol.
                Ergo protocol is designed to be survivable in the long-term, making it useful to implement contracts for a period of a person’s life and also enabling it to be a good store of value.

  translation: "Consensus protocol of Ergo — <a href=\"https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoPow.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\"><span>Autolykos</span></a> — is based on the well-known Proof-of-Work (“PoW”) consensus algorithm.
                  PoW was chosen for several reasons including that PoW protocols are widely studied, have high security guarantees, and are friendly to light clients.
                  However, Autolykos has several meaningful differences from Bitcoin's PoW.
                  It is memory-hard reducing the disparity between specialized hardware (ASICs) and commodity GPUs, allowing ordinary people to participate in mining to secure the network and receive the reward.
                  It has storage rent to reclaim lost and forgotten coins, Sigma Protocols, and so much more."

- id: basics_clients_title
  translation: Light Clients

- id: basics_clients
  translation: "It is almost impossible to use existing cryptocurrencies without the help of trusted third-parties. To receive even a small amount of coins in a trustless fashion, a client must download and process gigabytes of data to synchronize with the network, which may take several weeks even on high-end hardware, not to mention mobile devices. It is, therefore, no surprise that most users prefer to use trusted solutions for wallets, exchanges, block explorers and so on. <br/><br/>
                  Ergo was designed to be maximally user-friendly in the sense of decentralization. One of the important properties of PoW is that it enables verification of the work done without downloading the full chain. Ergo blocks support NiPoPoW proofs, allowing light clients to synchronize with the network by downloading less than a megabyte of data. Also, Ergo uses authenticated state, and for any transaction included, a client may download proof of its correctness. Thus, regardless of the blockchain size, a regular user with a smart-phone can join the network and start using Ergo with the same security guarantees as a full node."

  translation: Survivability

- id: basics_survivability
  translation: "To survive in the long-term, Ergo prefers well-tested solutions. If there isn't already a well-tested solution for some problem, we perform our own research, and the <a href=\"https://ergoplatform.org/en/documents/\" class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\"><span>number of peer-reviewed papers</span></a> from the Ergo development team is already extensive.
                  <br/><br/>  A resilient network should adapt to changing environment without the intervention of trusted parties (such as a ``core developer`` team). Ergo's on-chain miner voting protocol allows gradual changes in a large number of parameters including maximum block size, storage fee factor and more.
                  <br/><br/> For more fundamental changes Ergo is going to follow a soft-forkability approach --- if an overwhelming majority of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated, however, old nodes which do not upgrade continue to operate normally and just skip over this feature validation.
                  Thus disruptive hard forks should not be required in Ergo.

  translation: "
  To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, most central of which is a storage fee component which plays an important role for Ergo‘s stability: if an output remains in the state for 4 years without being moved, a miner may charge a small fee for every byte kept in the state.
  This idea is similar to regular cloud storage services, but it's application to blockchain systems has several significant consequences.
  First, Ergo mining will always be stable, unlike Bitcoin and other PoW currencies, in which mining may become unstable after the emission period.
  Second, state size growth becomes controllable and predictable reducing hardware requirements for Ergo miners. Third, by collecting storage fees from outdated boxes, miners return lost coins to circulation preventing a steady decrease of circulating supply due to lost keys. This also establishes a long‐term unique use case for <a class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\" href=\"https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoPow.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Ergo’s native token (“Erg”)</span></a> as the only token on the Ergo blockchain that can be used to pay for storage rent, despite the expected presence of a large number of non‐native tokens that may be issued on the Ergo blockchain in order to benefit from its strong security and decentralization qualities and Contractual Money functionality.  "

- id: basics_applicability_title
  translation: Applicability

- id: basics_applicability_paragraph
  translation: "
    Ergo DApps and offchain protocols may be implemented in a truly decentralized way due to light clients, however, they also require a flexible and safe smart contract language.
    Ergo smart contracts are based on a Bitcoin-like UTXO model, where every output is protected by some script.
    If the scripting language is rich enough, it enables writing of Turing-complete contracts while avoiding ad-hoc solutions for program halting like gas in Ethereum.
    While having significantly more versatility than Bitcoin script, Ergo script also contains operations, that allow accurate estimation of script complexity before execution, which prevents various DoS attacks and the “halting” problem.
    However, this instructions set is still sufficient enough to write any possible program — ErgoScript has been proven to be Turing complete.
    The cryptographic part of Ergo script is based on sigma protocols and naturally supports threshold m- of-n signatures, ring signatures and more.
    Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo’s design to make it uniquely useful as Contractual Money with countless applications possible."

- id: faq_first-item_title
  translation: What is Ergo?

- id: faq_first-item_text
  translation: "Ergo is a Resilient Platform for Contractual Money. It is designed to be a platform for applications with the main focus to provide an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts. <br/><br/>
    To achieve this goal, Ergo includes various technical and economic improvements to existing blockchain solutions. Every coin in Ergo is protected by a program in ErgoScript, which is a powerful and protocol friendly scripting language based on Σ-protocols. It specifies conditions under which a coin can be used: who can spend them, when, under what external conditions, to whom, and so on. <br/><br/>
    Extended support of light nodes makes Ergo friendly for end users and allows it to run contracts on common devices such as mobile phones trustlessly. To be useful in the long-term, Ergo is strictly following a long‐term survivability approach — it uses widely-researched solutions that are not going to result in security issues in the future, while also preventing performance degradation over time with a new economic model. <br/><br/>
    Finally, Ergo is a self‐amendable protocol, that allows it to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future.
    The focuses on long‐term survivability and self‐amendability are what give Ergo its resiliency.

  translation: "What does Contractual Money Mean?"

- id: faq_second-item_text
  translation: "In our opinion, the overwhelming majority of successful public blockchain use‐cases are related to financial applications.
    Ergo is extending Bitcoin’s way of writing contracts by attaching a protecting script (together with additional custom data) to every coin.
    Thus Ergo applications are defined in terms of guarding scripts built into boxes also containing data involved in execution.
    We coin the term Contractual Money for Ergs and secondary tokens which usage is bounded by a contract.
    For example, in addition to regular protection by some m‐of‐n signature, Ergo allows specifying, who are the possible recipients of these coins, which may also be a contract with such complex conditions. This \"chaining\" approach allows implementing secure and efficient contracts of arbitrary complexity."

- id: faq_third-item_title
  translation: What was the ICO price?

- id: faq_third-item_text
  translation: "Ergo is following the most decentralized way of emission and will start with zero coins in supply with the “minting” of the entire coin supply happening during the first eight years of Ergo mainnet, using the tried and tested PoW mining method. There was no ICO of Ergo. No VC Funding. No Pre mine."

- id: faq_fourth-item_title
  translation: "How to mine Ergo?"

- id: faq_fourth-item_text
  translation: "You need a <a class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\" href=\"https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node\"><span>configured Ergo node</span></a> and GPU with at least 4 Gb of memory (while 8 Gb is recommended for maximum efficiency). Use this <a class=\"eg-text__link eg-link\" href=\"https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Mining\"><span>guide</span></a> to configure miner together with the node. Note, that you may employ many GPUs together on one Ergo node."

  translation: "Does Ergo have a block size limit?"

- id: faq_seventh-item_text
  translation: "No, Ergo does not have a hard block size limit. Instead, the block size can increase or decrease over time based on demand. It is capped at a certain growth rate to prevent excessive growth in a short period of time."

- id: faq_eighth-item_title
  translation: "Why does Ergo have its own smart contract language?"

- id: faq_eighth-item_text
  translation: "The design space of programming languages is very broad ranging from
                general-purpose languages like C, Java, Python up to specialized languages
                like SQL, HTML, CSS,
                however, none of them was designed for the Contractual Money application.
                <br/><br/>
                ErgoScript was designed to achieve several properties.
                It only contains deterministic operations to maintain consensus in the network.
                To prevent possible spam attacks ErgoScript supports ahead-of-time cost estimation,
                excluding a wide range of operations like possibly infinite loops.
                But even keeping all these limitations in mind, ErgoScript is expressive enough to
                implement complex smart contracts, including Turing-complete smart contracts but in a secure manner."
